# Symmetries in DNNs

This repository contains two independent subprojects exploring symmetry concepts:

1. **MNIST_symmetries** - Analyzes and exploits symmetries in MLP for the MNIST classification
2. **IMAGENET_symmetries** - Investigates the formation and breaking of symmetries.

## Using Each Project

Each subproject has its own documentation and requirements:

1. **For MNIST_symmetries**:
   - See [MNIST_Symmetries/README.md](MNIST_symmetries/README.md) for detailed instructions

2. **For IMAGENET_symmetries**:
   - See [ImageNET_Symmetries/README.md](IMAGENET_symmetries/README.md) for specific instructions
